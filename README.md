# Fantasy-Islands-Resort-Experience



The FIRE organisation manages a number of luxury resorts. Each resort consists of a group of small
islands with a range of leisure facilities. Each island is connected by a ferry to one of more of the other
islands of the resort. When guests arrive, they get a Pass (like a credit/debit card) which they can use for
making payments at the resort. A Pass records a number of credits. We are concerned with using Passes
to pay for ferry journeys. FIRE want to track people at their resorts and they have decided to use the
Passes to do that. This project will be implemented at the Fortunate Islands Resort (then rolled out to other
resorts).
